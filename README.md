This is a lab task in my web engineering course. It is a static website made with html and css only. 

It is made in pure html with a little bit touch of css. You can use it in anyway . It'll be helpful for those who have
began to learn web development.However you shouldn't use my image.

The HTML used in it include

Basic html5 structure

div tags 

paragraph tags 

Table tags 

Anchor tags used for giving links

Image tags 

article tag 

header

navigation tag 

I have not made a separate css file rather all the css is in the same file which is not a good practice. But as this 
was a HTML lab so it was not necessary.

That's it. Happy Coding.
